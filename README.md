# TinyML
TinyML is an F# implementation of MetaLanguage's type inference system, albeit in a simplified form. This was a project assigned at the end of the course of [Functional Languages](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2022/LM/SC/SC2598/000ZZ/SCP6076299/N0) at the University of Padova. The [skeleton](https://github.com/alvisespano/FunctionalLanguages-UniPD/tree/main/2022-23/TinyML) of the project was provided by the course's professor Alvise Span√≤.

A [live demo](https://tiny-ml.pages.dev/) is available as a static web app.
