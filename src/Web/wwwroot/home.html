            TinyML is a type inference program for a reduced version of Milner's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)">ML</a> programming language.
            Syntactically, programs written in pure functional languages are expressions which contain other sub-expressions in a recursive fashion. Hence, it is possible to assign a type to a program, which is the type of the value returned by the program at the end of its execution.

            In this case, programs are formed either by a single expression or a chain of LET bindings followed by one last expression. For example:
        </p>
        <div class="box code-block">
            <pre class="pre"><code class="code">LET x = 5
                                                IN y = x
                                                IN x + y
            </code></pre>
        </div>
        <p>
            This program has type int, as it returns an addition between integers.
        </p>
